# MCP Ansible Drupal

**Project name:** `MCP-Ansible-Drupal`  
**Description:** Automates the setup and management of Ansible configurations for Drupal projects, including repository cloning, environment preparation, and cleanup, via a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolset.

---

## üì¶ Features

- Clones the official Ansible-Drupal repository for project bootstrapping.
- Moves and configures essential Ansible files (e.g., `ansible.cfg`, `vault_pass.txt`) into the project root.
- Cleans up temporary files and directories after setup to keep the workspace tidy.
- Provides modular tools and prompts for each step (clone, setup, cleanup).
- Designed for integration with MCP-based automation workflows.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Ansible (for target Drupal projects)

## üéØ Behavior

This MCP Ansible Drupal toolset includes the following functionalities:

- **Clone Repository:** Uses the `cloneRepositoryTool` and `cloneRepositoryPrompt` to fetch the Ansible-Drupal repository into a temporary directory (`/temporal`).
- **Ansible Setup:** Moves `ansible.cfg` and `vault_pass.txt` from the temporary directory to the project root using `ansibleSetupTool` and `ansibleSetupPrompt`.
- **Cleanup:** Removes `/temporal` and `/temporal/ansible-drupal` directories after setup with `ansibleCleanUpTool`.
- **Prompts:** Each tool is paired with a prompt for user interaction or automation.
- **Server:** The `server.ts` file can be used to expose these functionalities as part of an MCP server or CLI.
