# MCP Ansible Drupal

**Project name:** `MCP-Ansible-Drupal`  
**Description:** Automates the setup and management of Ansible configurations for Drupal projects, including repository cloning, environment preparation, and cleanup, via a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolset.

---

## 📦 Features

- Clones the official DrupAnsible repository for project bootstrapping.
- Moves and configures essential Ansible files (e.g., `ansible.cfg`, `vault_pass.txt`) into the project root.
- Cleans up temporary files and directories after setup to keep the workspace tidy.
- Provides modular tools and prompts for each step (clone, setup, cleanup).
- Designed for integration with MCP-based automation workflows.

## ✅ Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- TypeScript
- Ansible (for target Drupal projects)

---

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository into your project directory.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

---

## 🎯 Behavior

- **Clone Repository:** Uses the `cloneRepositoryTool` and `cloneRepositoryPrompt` to fetch the DrupAnsible repository into a temporary directory (`/temporal`).
- **Ansible Setup:** Moves `ansible.cfg` and `vault_pass.txt` from the temporary directory to the project root using `ansibleSetupTool` and `ansibleSetupPrompt`.
- **Cleanup:** Removes `/temporal` and `/temporal/drupansible` directories after setup with `ansibleCleanUpTool`.
- **Prompts:** Each tool is paired with a prompt for user interaction or automation.
- **Server:** The `server.ts` file can be used to expose these functionalities as part of an MCP server or CLI.

---

## 💡 Prompt Example

You can use the following prompt to automate the full DrupAnsible setup process:

```
Clone the Drupansible repository into the /temporal directory using the cloneRepository tool.
After cloning, run the ansibleSetup tool to move the Ansible configuration files and tools to the project root.
Then run the ansibleCleanup tool to completely remove the /temporal directory, even if it contains other files or folders.
```

---

## 🧩 Developer Notes

- Tools and prompts are modular and can be extended for additional Ansible or Drupal automation tasks.
- Designed for integration with larger MCP-based automation or orchestration systems.
- Ensure Ansible is installed and configured on the target environment for full functionality.
